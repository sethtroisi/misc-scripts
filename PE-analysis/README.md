# Some Analysis of Top Project Euler Solvers

Project Euler asks members not to discuss or share solutions to problems after #200.

Sadly a certain member maintains a list of solutions on their GitHub.

I personally feel most sad when a user has many more problems solved than me
but doesn't give back to the community (no posts in the discussion threads).

### Data

1. Compute timestamp of when solution was published to GitHub
1. Collect list of finish times for fastest solvers
1. Collect list of members by number solved

### Analysis

1. List of top 100/500 members with a top 5 finish
1. List of top 100/500 members with the first/second/third post in a forum with non-trivial comment
1. List of top 500 members without (1 or 2) who have never solved a problem prior to the solution published time
